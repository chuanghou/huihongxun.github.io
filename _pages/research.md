- **Modeling and Potential Analysis of Flexible Loads** *(Sep. 2015 – Jun. 2016, Nanjing, China)*
  - *Supported by China Electric Power Research Institute* (No. DZ71-15-004)
  - Position: Project director
  - Supervisor: Prof. Yi Ding
    - Models of typical flexible loads are developed, including air conditionings, EVs and batteries. The response characteristics with real-time electricity prices are also analyzed.
    - A potential evaluation method and an uncertainty analysis method of flexible loads for participating in ancillary services are proposed.
    - A technical report, three journal papers and a conference paper have been published.

- **Research and Application of Demand Response** *(Mar. 2016 – Nov. 2016, Nanjing, China)*
  - *Supported by State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd* (No. KH20161699)
  - Position: Project director
  - Supervisor: Prof. Yi Ding
    - Based on the existing electricity organization structure and market environment in China, a market mechanism and implementation plan of demand response are developed.
    - A new spike price policy is implemented based on the original peak-valley price policy. According to the energy efficiency evaluation report in Jiangsu Province, the investments in power plants and transmission lines decrease around 16.78 billion RMB.
    - A technical report and two journal papers have been published.

- **Research on Peak-shaving Capacities of Flexible Loads Considering Renewable Energies** *(Jan. 2016 – Dec. 2017, Hangzhou, China)*
  - *Supported by State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd* (No. 5211JY15001S)
  - Position: Project director
  - Supervisor: Prof. Yi Ding
    - Peak-shaving capacities of flexible loads are evaluated quantitatively. An operation mechanism model is also developed considering the uncertainty of flexible loads.
    - The access abilities of renewable energies are studied before and after flexible loads participating in peak-shaving. The reliability and economy of the system are evaluated.
    - Three technical reports, two journal papers, two conference papers and two patents are published or submitted.

- **Market Mechanism Design for Demand Response** *(Jul. 2016 – Jun. 2020, Nanjing, China)*
  - *Supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of China* (No. 2016YFB0901103)
  - Position: Project director
  - Supervisor: Prof. Yi Ding
    - A business model and a market framework are designed for loads to participate in demand response project. The calculation of electricity prices, the transaction method and the settlement method are established.
    - Around 110,000 residential customers, 1,000 large industrial customers and 730 commercial customers will be equipped with smart devices to provide demand response.
    - The objectives are to reduce the load peak-valley difference by 5.8% and the energy consumption by 5.5% at the end year 2020, compared with the start year 2016.
    - At present, five journal papers, four conference papers and three patents have been published or accepted.

- **Reliability Analysis and Optimization of Smart Grid Considering the Coordinated Operation of Flexible Resources and Wind Power** *(Jan. 2016 – Dec. 2019, Hangzhou, China)*
  - *Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China* (No. 51577167)
  - Position: Project participant
  - Supervisor: Prof. Yi Ding
    - The basic mechanism causing multiple uncertainties of different types of flexible resources is analyzed. The reliability models of these flexible resources are also established.
    - A novel reliability evaluation method for power systems is developed considering the coupling effects between wind power and flexible resources.
    - A multi-time scale dispatch model considering cooperation between wind power and flexible resources is developed.
