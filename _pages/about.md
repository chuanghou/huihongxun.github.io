I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [College of Electrical Engineering](http://ee.zju.edu.cn/index.php), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Yi Ding](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/110) and Prof. [Yonghua Song](https://rto.um.edu.mo/biography/). Previously, I received the B. Eng degree from the [College of Electrical Engineering](http://ee.zju.edu.cn/index.php), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2015, under the supervision of Prof. [Chuangxin Guo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gordon).

I am a member of [Smart Grid Operation and Optimization Laboratory (SGOOL)](http://sgool.cn/en/index.php). My research interests are the coordinated control and market mechanism of flexible loads considering high penetration of renewable energies, including the modeling and control method of flexible loads, the electricity market considering demand response, and the uncertainty analysis brought by flexible loads and renewable energies.

Here is my CV.
